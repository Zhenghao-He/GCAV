## ðŸ§© Overview

**Global Concept Activation Vector (GCAV)** is a novel framework designed to improve the interpretability of deep neural networks by unifying Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) into a globally consistent representation. Unlike traditional **TCAV**, which independently computes CAVs at each layer, GCAV **aligns and integrates CAVs** across layers using:
- **Contrastive learning** to ensure concept representations are semantically aligned.
- **Attention-based fusion** to construct a unified global concept representation.
- **Decoder-based projection** to reconstruct per-layer concept vectors, allowing TCAV to be applied to GCAV representations (**TGCAV**).

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Cross-Layer Concept Consistency**: Mitigates inconsistencies in TCAV scores across layers.
- **Improved Concept Localization**: Enhances interpretability by refining concept attributions.
- **Adversarial Robustness**: Provides more stable explanations under adversarial perturbations.
- **Flexible & Scalable**: Works with multiple deep architectures (e.g., ResNet, GoogleNet, MobileNet).
